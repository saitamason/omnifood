This project was created as a part of the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ "Udemy") course _Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS_ by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman "Jonas Schmedtmann on Twitter").

In the project I used among others:

- Flex box
- CSS grid
- Media queries
- JS intersection observer
- NPM Parcel as a build tool
